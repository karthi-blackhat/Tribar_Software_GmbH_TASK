# Tribar_Software_GmbH_TASK
My development environment is a Windows 10 PC with Python 3.7.4 and Tensorflow 2.2.0 installed.
To get the program running, I first imported the necessary libraries - Tensorflow, Matplotlib and NumPy. 
Then I created the neural network architecture for both toggle switch circuit and XOR function.
I defined the input, hidden, and output layers, as well as the target and loss functions.
The program was trained and tested successfully and provided the output of acurracy and loss for the model in plots.
